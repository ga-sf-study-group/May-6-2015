<h2>Problem #1 - Is Palindrome</h2>

<p>Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”</p>

<h2>Problem #2 - Mortgage Calculator</h2>
<p>Calculate the monthly payments of a fixed term mortgage over given Nth terms at a given interest rate. Also figure out how long it will take the user to pay back the loan. For added complexity, add an option for users to select the compounding interval (Monthly, Weekly, Daily, Continually).</p>

<h2>Problem #3 - Counting Sundays</h2>
<p>You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research for yourself.

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.<br>
Thirty days has September,<br>
April, June and November.<br>
All the rest have thirty-one,<br>
Saving February alone,<br>
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.<br>
And on leap years, twenty-nine.<br>
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century unless it is divisible by 400.<br>
How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century (1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?</p>
